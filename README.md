# Multi-Screen Form Validation in Flutter

## Overview
This Flutter application implements a multi-screen form validation system with two screens:

1. **Personal Info Screen** - Collects user's personal details such as name, age, and address.
2. **Contact Info Screen** - Collects user's contact details like email, phone number, and emergency contact.

Each screen includes validation rules for user input and allows seamless navigation between them. A confirmation dialog is displayed upon successful completion of the form.
